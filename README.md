# MemoryGame
A Memory Game created as a project required by Udacity

1. The game randomly shuffles the cards. A user wins once all cards have successfully been matched.
2. When a user wins the game, a popup window appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. 
It also tells the user how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.
3. A restart button allows the player to reset the game board, the timer, and the star rating.
4. The game displays a star rating (from 1 to 3) that reflects the player's performance. 
At the beginning of a game 3 stars are displayed. After some number of moves, the star rating lowers and continues to 
lower as the move count increases. 
5. When the player starts a game, a timer is started. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.
6. The game displays the current number of moves a user has made.
7. The user has the option to select which deck of cards to play. The themes are 
- Emoji
- Fruit
- Christmas
- Social media icons
